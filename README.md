# django-unicorn.com

This is the documentation site for [`Unicorn`](https://www.django-unicorn.com/). It includes the Sphinx-generated docs, code examples, screenshares, and a landing page.

## Why?

[readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org/) is an awesome resource and I love that they provide a free way to host documentation for open-source projects. However, to show off the power of `Unicorn` it seems best for the documentation site to have real-world examples of how it works. Plus, serving the Sphinx docs directly (via [django-docs](https://django-docs.readthedocs.io/)) improves the SEO traffic (since the docs are served from a sub-folder instead of a third-level domain).
