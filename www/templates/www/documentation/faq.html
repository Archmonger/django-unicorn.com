        <h5 class="question">
            Do I need to learn a new frontend framework for <code>django-unicorn</code>?
        </h5>

        <p>
            Nope! <code>django-unicorn</code> gives you some magical template tags and HTML attributes to sprinkle in normal Django HTML templates. The backend code is a simple class that ultimately derives from <code>TemplateView</code>. Keep using the same Django HTML templates, template tags, filters, etc and the best-in-class Django ORM without learning another new framework of the week.
        </p>

        <h5 class="question">
            Do I need to build an entire API to use <code>django-unicorn</code>?
        </h5>

        <p>
            Nope! <code>Django REST framework</code> is pretty magical on its own, and if you will need a mobile app or other use for a REST API, it's a great set of abstractions to follow REST best practices. But, it can be challenging implementing a robust API even with <code>Django REST framework</code>. And I wouldn't even attempt to build an API up from scratch unless it was extremely limited.
        </p>

        <h5 class="question">
            Do I need to need to install GraphQL to use <code>django-unicorn</code>?
        </h5>

        <p>
            Nope! GraphQL looks like an awesome technology for specific use-cases and solves some pain points around creating a RESTful API. But, it is another peiece of technology to wrestle with.
        </p>

        <h5 class="question">
            Do I need to run an annoying separate node.js process or learn any tedious Webpack configuration incantations to use <code>django-unicorn</code>?
        </h5>

        <p>
            Nope! <code>django-unicorn</code> <a href="{% url 'www:documentation' name='installation' %}">installs</a> just like any normal Django package and is seamless to implement. There <em>are</em> a few "magic" attributes to sprinkle into a Django HTML template, but other than that it's just like building a regular server-side application.
        </p>

        <h5 class="question">
            Does this replace Vue.js or React?
        </h5>

        <p>
            Nope! In some cases, you might need to actually build an <span title="single-page application">SPA</span> in which case <code>django-unicorn</code> really isn't that helpful. In that case you might have to invest the time to learn a more involved frontend framework. Read <a href="https://tkainrad.dev/posts/use-vuejs-with-django/">Using VueJS alongside Django</a> for one approach.
        </p>

        <h5 class="question">
            Isn't calling an AJAX endpoint on every input slow?
        </h5>

        <p>
            Not really! <code>django-unicorn</code> is ideal for when an AJAX call would already be required (such as hitting an API for typeahead search or update data in a database). If that isn't required, the <a href="{% url 'www:documentation' 'components/templates' %}#lazy">lazy</a> and <a href="{% url 'www:documentation' 'components/templates' %}#debounce">debounce</a> modifiers can also be used to prevent an AJAX call on every change.
        </p>

        <h5 class="question">
            But, what about security?
        </h5>

        <p>
            <code>django-unicorn</code> follows the best practices of Django and requires a <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/csrf/#how-it-works">CSRF token</a> to be set on any page that has a component. This ensures that no nefarious AJAX POSTs can be executed. <code>django-unicorn</code> also creates a unique component checksum with the Django <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#std:setting-SECRET_KEY">secret key</a> on every data change which also ensures that all updates are valid.
