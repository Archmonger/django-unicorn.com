        <p>
            <code>django-unicorn</code> is a magical full-stack framework for Django. Instead of building additional API
            endpoints just to provide some interactivity, <code>django-unicorn</code> is a much simpler way to provide pieces of a
            modern website experience without moving away from all of the benefits of Django.
        </p>

        <p>
            The goal is provide ways to seamlessly extend Django past its server-side framework roots without giving up
            all of its niceties or having to re-build a site in a frontend framework.
